# Enterprise Procurement Management System - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Overview
This document outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan for the new Enterprise Procurement Management System. The purpose of this UAT is to validate that the system meets the business requirements and is ready for production deployment. The testing will be conducted by end-users representing various roles within the procurement lifecycle to ensure the system is functional, intuitive, and aligns with the organization's operational workflows.

### 1.2. Objectives
- To verify that the end-to-end procurement workflow functions as designed, from needs recognition to final payment.
- To confirm that all user roles have the appropriate permissions and access levels.
- To ensure all business rules, including the approval matrix and committee scoring, are correctly implemented.
- To validate the system's handling of standard and exception-based scenarios (e.g., vendor declines, per-item awards).
- To identify and document any defects, usability issues, or gaps in functionality before go-live.
- To obtain formal sign-off from business stakeholders, confirming the system's readiness for production.

### 1.3. Scope

#### 1.3.1. In-Scope Modules & Features
- User Authentication & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Requisition Creation and Management
- Departmental & Hierarchical Approval Workflows
- RFQ (Request for Quotation) Generation and Distribution
- Vendor Management & KYC Verification
- Vendor Portal: Quotation Submission & Award Response
- Committee Assignment & Evaluation (Financial & Technical Scoring)
- Awarding (Single Vendor & Per-Item)
- Minute Document Upload & Digital Signature Workflow
- Purchase Order (PO) Generation
- Goods Receipt Note (GRN) Creation & Management
- Three-Way Matching (PO vs. GRN vs. Invoice)
- Invoice & Payment Processing
- Audit Trails & Document Records
- System Notifications (Email)
- Session Management & Security Policies (CSP)

#### 1.3.2. Out-of-Scope
- Performance, stress, or load testing.
- Underlying infrastructure or database migration testing.
- Direct integration testing with external banking or accounting systems (functionality will be simulated).
- Changes to the UI theme, branding, or layout that are not functional defects.

### 1.4. Assumptions
- A stable, production-like test environment is available.
- The test environment has been populated with realistic seed data that covers all required user roles, departments, vendors, and settings.
- All testers have been provided with the necessary credentials and have access to the test environment.
- Any critical or blocking defects found during testing will be prioritized and resolved by the development team before UAT completion.
